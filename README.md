# Project 2: Command Line Shell

See: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/assignments/project-2.html


I know the code style isnt the best but I have had a garbage week and this project has put me through hell so I am just going to take the L on this one. I know what all the code style errors are and I will fix them in the future because I want to make a pretty and efficient shell but I can't muster up the energy to do that now.
